This my first project after learning the basics of javascript and its event  handling. This is a simple addition subtraction project which we named as 'The Boys Bank'

To access the website you can use the credential as below:
till 15/08/2023 I used a normal if else check for only one user in our website. Hopefully, we can use modern technique in my upcoming project when I will learn those.

credential: <br>
boys@regim.com <br>
password: 123boys


In this website, I have added deposit and withdraw button with realtime balance changing using JS. Also, user can not give string or -(negative) number in case of deposit. In addition, can't try to withdraw more money than his actual balance.

the website is live in this link
